Welcome to Melon!
===================


Melon is a C framework library for simplifying-development on UNIX. 
Why is a library? Because it includes many implementations about data structures, algorithms, architectures and many other useful components that you can choose that only use these APIs or whole framework (especially architectures) based on your demand.
Melon supports both multi-process and multithreads models. And it provides a method which is the same as process development to develop thread modules.
The goal of Melon is trying to simplify the module development (no matter a process or thread) and guarantee the performance.

For more details, please see *Melon Developer Guide* in *melon/doc*.
