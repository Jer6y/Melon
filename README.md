Welcome to Melon!
===================


Melon is a software platform for simplifying-development on UNIX. 
Why is a platform? Because it allows other programs running on it and Melon will keep them alive automatically (of course, you can set not to restart processes after they are dead). In addition, it provides many interfaces to develop application programs.
Melon supports both multi-process and multithreads models. And it provides a method which is the same as process development to develop thread modules.
The goal of Melon is trying to simplify the module development (no matter a process or thread) and guarantee the performance.

For more details,  please see *Melon Developer Guide* in *melon/doc*.
